# React-movies

This is a small application to get some training of working with backend APIs as well as to get some React.js coding practice.

This application allows user to get some movies/games cards and filter them by category as needed. I also incorporated pagination functional in to this page.

### Technical stack used for this project:

- React.js in combination with native JS
- CSS framework in combination with ownn stylesheet
- Create_React_App in combination with NPM for customization, building and deploying the project
- GIT and github/github pages

Most of CSS styles were taken from [materializeCSS library](https://materializecss.com/) with adding some particular own style if/as needed.

As backend application I've used free API [omdbAPI](http://www.omdbapi.com/)

The page deployment may be seen by the following [link](###).
